# The Emotion Atlas

## Project Overview
The Emotion Atlas is a unique data storytelling web application that allows users to track, visualize, and explore emotional patterns in their lives. Unlike standard mood trackers, this application presents emotions as a historical archive with vintage aesthetics, plotting emotional journeys on old paper-styled maps and timelines.

## Features
- **Emotion Input**: Log your current emotion along with contextual tags like weather, activity, food, and music
- **Emotion Timeline**: Visualize your emotional journey across days, weeks, and months with vintage-styled charts
- **Emotion Atlas/Map**: View emotion clusters represented on an old-paper styled map
- **Historical Logs**: Browse through past emotions styled like old journal entries
- **Contextual Insights**: Discover patterns in your emotional data
- **Vintage UI**: Experience a historical archive aesthetic with parchment textures and typewriter fonts

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js with styled-components
- **Data Storage**: Local Storage (browser-based)
- **Data Visualization**: D3.js for custom vintage-styled visualizations
